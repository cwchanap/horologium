# horologium

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

### Local agent commands

The repo ships with `.opencode/command` as a repository-relative symlink to
`.claude/commands` so tooling can find the shared command definitions. If the
symlink is missing, recreate it from the repo root:

```sh
ln -s ../.claude/commands .opencode/command
```

samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
